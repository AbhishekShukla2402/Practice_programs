Program that detects peaks and their indices in given list. A peak is a number that is greater than the one before and one after.
example: [1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,1,2,3,2,1]
Here the peaks are 4, 2 and 3.

In case of [1,2,3,3,3,3,3,2,1]
The peak will be 3 and the first occurence of said number will be a peak.

[1,2,1,4,5,6,6,6,3,2,1,2,1]
Here peak 2 is at index 1, peak 6 is at index 5 and peak 2 is at index 7
