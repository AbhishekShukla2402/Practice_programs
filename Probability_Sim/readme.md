A program that aims to run a simulation of the Bertrands box paradox.
There are three boxes:

    A box containing two gold coins,
    A box containing two silver coins,
    A box containing one gold coin and one silver coin.

After choosing a box at random and withdrawing one coin at random, if that happens to be a gold coin, find probability of the next coin drawn from the same box also being a gold coin.
